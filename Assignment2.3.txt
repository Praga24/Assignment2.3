Components of Hadoop 1.x :

There are 5 components in hadoop 1.x:
1.NameNode
2.Secondary NameNode
3.DataNode
4.JobTracker
5.TaskTracker
 :

1.NameNode
• Contains the Hadoop FileSystem Tree and other metadata information about files and
directories
• Contains in-memory mapping of which blocks are stored in which datanode


2.Secondary Namenode
• Performs house-keeping activities for NameNode, like periodic merging of namespace and
edits
• Not a back up for NameNode


3.DataNode
• Stores actual data blocks of file in HDFS on its own local disk
• Sends signals to NameNode periodically (called as Heartbeat) to verify if it is active
• Sends block reporting to the NameNode on cluster startup as well as periodically at
every 10th Heartbeat
• The DataNode are the workhorse of the system
• They perform all the block operations, including periodic the Checksum. They receive
instructions from the NameNode of where to put the blocks and how to put the blocks.

4.JobTracker :
• Controls overall execution of map reduce jobs


5.TaskTracker :
• Runs individual map-reduce jobs on DataNodes
• Periodically communicates with the JobTracker to give updates and receive instructions
